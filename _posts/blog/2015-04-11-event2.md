###Introduction to event
This talk is in line with IISc-SIAM's Math Drives Careers awareness campaign. To increase awareness of the opportunities for careers using mathematics, we host [Prof. Philip K. Maini,](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/) Wolfson Centre for Mathematical Biology, University of Oxford to share experiences on aspects of solid tumour growth.

###Topic
> Modelling Aspects of Solid Tumour Growth.

In this talk I will review some work we have done on aspects of solid
tumour growth.
This will consist of three cases studies modelling:

<ol>
<li>Acid-mediated cell invasion.</li>
<li>Movement through heterogeneous media, with application to glioblastoma. </li>
<li>Colorectal crypt dynamics. The models range from coupled systems of nonlinear partial differential equations to discrete cell-based models.</li>
</ol>

In each case, results will be compared with experiment and the mathematical challenges raised highlighted.

[Philip K. Maini](https://people.maths.ox.ac.uk/maini/) received his B.A. in mathematics from Balliol College, Oxford, in 1982 and his DPhil in 1985 under the supervision of Prof J.D. Murray, FRS. After completing his studies he spent a year as an Assistant Master at Eton College before returning to the WCMB in 1987 as a Junior Research Fellow at Wolfson College, Oxford. In 1988 he was appointed Assistant Professor in the Mathematics 
Department at the University of Utah, Salt Lake City before returning to Oxford two years later, initially as a University Lecturer and then as Professor and Director of the WCMB. He is currently on the editorial boards of a large number of journals, including serving as the Editor-in-Chief of the Bulletin of Mathematical Biology. He has also been an elected member of the Boards of the Society for Mathematical Biology (SMB) and European Society for Mathematical and Theoretical Biology (ESMBTB). He is a Fellow of the IMA, a SIAM Fellow, a fellow of the Society of Biology,and Miembro Correspondiente, La Academia Mexicana de Ciencias (AMC) in 2011.

<p>His present research projects include the modelling of avascular and vascular tumours, normal and abnormal wound healing, and a number of applications of mathematical modelling in pattern formation in early development, as well as the theoretical analysis of the mathematical models that arise in all these applications. He has over 300 publications in the field and has held visiting positions at a number of universities worldwide. He was a Distinguished Foreign Visiting Fellow, Hokkaido University (2002). In 2005 he was elected Honorary Guest Professor, University of Electronic Science Science and Technology of China, Chengdu, in 2006 appointed to a 3-year Adjunct Professorship at the School of Mathematical Sciences, Queensland University of Technology, Brisbane (and again in 2012 and 2014), in 2010 appointed to a 3-year Adjunct Professorship at Lincoln University, Christchurch, New Zealand, and also appointed as a Distinguished Research Fellow at the African Institute for Mathematical Sciences (AIMS), South Africa.</p>

<p>He co-authored a Bellman Prize winning paper (1997), was awarded a Royal Society Leverhulme Trust Senior Research Fellowship for 2001-2 and a Royal Society-Wolfson Research Merit Award (2006-11). In 2009 he was awarded the LMS Naylor Prize and Lectureship.</p>
